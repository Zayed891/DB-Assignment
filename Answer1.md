The "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product category can have multiple products, but each product can only belong to one category.This relationship is represented by the category_id field in the "Product" table. This field is a foreign key that references the id field in the "Product_Category" table.When the category_id in the "Product" table matches the id in the "Product_Category" table, it means that the product belongs to that category.
This kind of relationship allows for efficient querying and data integrity. For example, we can easily find all products that belong to a certain category, or find the category of a certain product. It also ensures that every product has a valid category, as the category_id must correspond to an existing id in the "Product_Category" table.
